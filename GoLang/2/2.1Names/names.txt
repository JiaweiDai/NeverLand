/**
 * The names of Go functions, variables, constants, types, statement labels, and packages follow a simple rule: a name begins with a
 * letter (that is, anything that Unicode deems a letter) or an underscore and may have any number of additional letters, digits, and
 * underscores. Case matters : heapSort and Heapsort are different names.
 *
 * Go has 25 keywords, they can't be used as names.
 *
 * break		default		func		interface	select
 * case			defer		go			map			struct
 * chan			else		goto		package		switch
 * const		fallthrough	if			range		type
 * continue		for			import		return		var
 *
 * In addition, there are about three dozen predeclared names like int and true for built-in constants, types, and functions.
 *
 * Constants:  	true 	false 	iota 	nil
 *
 * Types: 		int			int8		int16			int32		int64
 *				uint		uint8		uint16			uint32		uint64		uintptr
 *				float32		float64		complex128		complex64
 *				bool		byte		rune			string		error
 *
 *
 * Functions:	make		len		cap		new		append		copy		close		delete
 *				complex		real	imag
 *				panic		recover
 *
 *
 * These names are not reserved, so you may use them in declarations. We'll see a handful of places where redeclaring one of them
 * makes sense, but beware of the potential for confusion.

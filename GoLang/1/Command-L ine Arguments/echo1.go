	 * Parentheses are never used around the three componets of a for loop.
	 * The braces are mandatory, however the opening brace must be on the same line as the post statement.

	 * 
	 * If initialization statements present, it must be a simple statement , that is :
	 * a short variable declaration , an increment or assignment statement, or a function call.
	 *
	 * condition is a boolean expression that is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration of the loop; 
	 * if it evaluates to true,the statements controlled by the loop are executed.
	 *
	 * The post statement is executed after the body of the loop, then the condition is evaluated again.
